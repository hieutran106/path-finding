# A\* seach algorithm

A\* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.

# PathFinding project

Learning computer science algorithm gets much easier with visualizing it. This repo aims at learning A\* path finding algorithm with ease as visualization is a mean to insight.
